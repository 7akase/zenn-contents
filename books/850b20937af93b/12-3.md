\section{Colimits}

Just like all constructions in category theory, limits have their dual
image in opposite categories. When you invert the direction of all
arrows in a cone, you get a co-cone, and the universal one of those is
called a colimit. Notice that the inversion also affects the factorizing
morphism, which now flows from the universal co-cone to any other
co-cone.

\noindent
A typical example of a colimit is a coproduct, which corresponds to the
diagram generated by $\cat{2}$, the category we've used in the
definition of the product.

\noindent
Both the product and the coproduct embody the essence of a pair of
objects, each in a different way.

Just like the terminal object was a limit, so the initial object is a
colimit corresponding to the diagram based on an empty category.

The dual of the pullback is called the \emph{pushout}. It's based on a
diagram called a span, generated by the category
$1\leftarrow2\rightarrow3$.
