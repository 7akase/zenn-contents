title: "極限の例"

We've seen that the categorical product is a limit of a diagram
generated by a simple category we called $\cat{2}$.

There is an even simpler example of a limit: the terminal object. The
first impulse would be to think of a singleton category as leading to a
terminal object, but the truth is even starker than that: the terminal
object is a limit generated by an empty category. A functor from an
empty category selects no object, so a cone shrinks to just the apex.
The universal cone is the lone apex that has a unique morphism coming to
it from any other apex. You will recognize this as the definition of the
terminal object.

The next interesting limit is called the \emph{equalizer}. It's a limit
generated by a two-element category with two parallel morphisms going
between them (and, as always, the identity morphisms). This category
selects a diagram in $\cat{C}$ consisting of two objects, $a$ and
$b$, and two morphisms:

\src{snippet03}

To build a cone over this diagram, we have to add the apex, $c$
and two projections:

\src{snippet04}

\end{figure}

\noindent
We have two triangles that must commute:

\src{snippet05}

This tells us that $q$ is uniquely determined by one of these
equations, say, \code{q = f . p}, and we can omit it from the
picture. So we are left with just one condition:

\src{snippet06}

The way to think about it is that, if we restrict our attention to
$\Set$, the image of the function $p$ selects a subset of
$a$. When restricted to this subset, the functions $f$ and
$g$ are equal.

For instance, take $a$ to be the two-dimensional plane
parameterized by coordinates $x$ and $y$. Take $b$
to be the real line, and take:

\src{snippet07}

The equalizer for these two functions is the set of real numbers (the
apex, $c$) and the function:

\src{snippet08}

Notice that $(p~t)$ defines a straight line in the
two-dimensional plane. Along this line, the two functions are equal.

Of course, there are other sets $c'$ and functions
$p'$ that may lead to the equality:

\src{snippet09}

but they all uniquely factor out through $p$. For instance, we
can take the singleton set $\cat{()}$ as $c'$ and the
function:

\src{snippet10}

It's a good cone, because $f (0, 0) = g (0, 0)$. But it's
not universal, because of the unique factorization through $h$:

\src{snippet11}

with

\src{snippet12}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/equilizerlimit.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent
An equalizer can thus be used to solve equations of the type
$f~x = g~x$. But it's much more general, because it's defined
in terms of objects and morphisms rather than algebraically.

An even more general idea of solving an equation is embodied in another
limit --- the pullback. Here, we still have two morphisms that we want
to equate, but this time their domains are different. We start with a
three-object category of the shape:
$1\rightarrow2\leftarrow3$. The diagram corresponding to
this category consists of three objects, $a$, $b$, and
$c$, and two morphisms:

\src{snippet13}

This diagram is often called a \emph{cospan}.

A cone built on top of this diagram consists of the apex, $d$,
and three morphisms:

\src{snippet14}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/pullbackcone.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Commutativity conditions tell us that $r$ is completely
determined by the other morphisms, and can be omitted from the picture.
So we are only left with the following condition:

\src{snippet15}
A pullback is a universal cone of this shape.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/pullbacklimit.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Again, if you narrow your focus down to sets, you can think of the
object $d$ as consisting of pairs of elements from $a$ and
$c$ for which $f$ acting on the first component is equal
to $g$ acting on the second component. If this is still too
general, consider the special case in which $g$ is a constant
function, say $g~\_ = 1.23$ (assuming that $b$ is a set
of real numbers). Then you are really solving the equation:

\src{snippet16}

In this case, the choice of $c$ is irrelevant (as long as it's
not an empty set), so we can take it to be a singleton set. The set
$a$ could, for instance, be the set of three-dimensional vectors,
and $f$ the vector length. Then the pullback is the set of pairs
$(v, ())$, where $v$ is a vector of length 1.23 (a
solution to the equation $\sqrt{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})} = 1.23$), and
$()$ is the dummy element of the singleton set.

But pullbacks have more general applications, also in programming. For
instance, consider C++ classes as a category in which morphism are
arrows that connect subclasses to superclasses. We'll consider
inheritance a transitive property, so if \code{C} inherits from \code{B} and \code{B}
inherits from \code{A} then we'll say that \code{C} inherits from \code{A} (after all, you
can pass a pointer to \code{C} where a pointer to \code{A} is expected). Also, we'll
assume that \code{C} inherits from \code{C}, so we have the identity arrow for every
class. This way subclassing is aligned with subtyping. C++ also supports
multiple inheritance, so you can construct a diamond inheritance diagram
with two classes \code{B} and \code{C} inheriting from \code{A}, and a fourth class \code{D}
multiply inheriting from \code{B} and \code{C}. Normally, \code{D} would get two copies of \code{A},
which is rarely desirable; but you can use virtual inheritance to have
just one copy of \code{A} in \code{D}.

What would it mean to have \code{D} be a pullback in this diagram? It would
mean that any class \code{E} that multiply inherits from \code{B} and \code{C} is also a
subclass of \code{D}. This is not directly expressible in C++, where subtyping
is nominal (the C++ compiler wouldn't infer this kind of class
relationship --- it would require ``duck typing''). But we could go
outside of the subtyping relationship and instead ask whether a cast
from \code{E} to \code{D} would be safe or not. This cast would be safe if \code{D} were the
bare-bone combination of \code{B} and \code{C}, with no additional data and no
overriding of methods. And, of course, there would be no pullback if
there is a name conflict between some methods of \code{B} and \code{C}.

\end{figure}

\noindent
There's also a more advanced use of a pullback in type inference. There
is often a need to \emph{unify} types of two expressions. For instance,
suppose that the compiler wants to infer the type of a function:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
twice f x = f (f x)
\end{snip}
It will assign preliminary types to all variables and sub-expressions.
In particular, it will assign:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
f       :: t0
x       :: t1
f x     :: t2
f (f x) :: t3
\end{snip}
from which it will deduce that:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
twice :: t0 -> t1 -> t3
\end{snip}
It will also come up with a set of constraints resulting from the rules
of function application:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
t0 = t1 -> t2 -- because f is applied to x 
t0 = t2 -> t3 -- because f is applied to (f x)
\end{snip}
These constraints have to be unified by finding a set of types (or type
variables) that, when substituted for the unknown types in both
expressions, produce the same type. One such substitution is:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
t1 = t2 = t3 = Int 
twice :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int
\end{snip}
but, obviously, it's not the most general one. The most general
substitution is obtained using a pullback. I won't go into the details,
because they are beyond the scope of this book, but you can convince
yourself that the result should be:

\begin{snip}{haskell}
twice :: (t -> t) -> t -> t
\end{snip}
with \code{t} a free type variable.
