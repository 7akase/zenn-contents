I said previously that functors come close to the idea of continuous
mappings of categories, in the sense that they never break existing
connections (morphisms). The actual definition of a \emph{continuous
functor} $F$ from a category $\cat{C}$ to $\cat{C'}$ includes the
requirement that the functor preserve limits. Every diagram $D$
in $\cat{C}$ can be mapped to a diagram $F \circ D$ in $\cat{C'}$ by
simply composing two functors. The continuity condition for $F$
states that, if the diagram $D$ has a limit $\Lim[D]$, then
the diagram $F \circ D$ also has a limit, and it is equal to
$F (\Lim[D])$.

\noindent
Notice that, because functors map morphisms to morphisms, and
compositions to compositions, an image of a cone is always a cone. A
commuting triangle is always mapped to a commuting triangle (functors
preserve composition). The same is true for the factorizing morphisms:
the image of a factorizing morphism is also a factorizing morphism. So
every functor is \emph{almost} continuous. What may go wrong is the
uniqueness condition. The factorizing morphism in $\cat{C'}$ might not be
unique. There may also be other ``better cones'' in $\cat{C'}$ that were
not available in $\cat{C}$.

A hom-functor is an example of a continuous functor. Recall that the
hom-functor, $\cat{C}(a, b)$, is contravariant in the first variable
and covariant in the second. In other words, it's a functor:
\[\cat{C}^{op} \times \cat{C} \to \Set\]
When its second argument is fixed, the hom-set functor (which becomes
the representable presheaf) maps colimits in $\cat{C}$ to limits in
$\Set$; and when its first argument is fixed, it maps limits to
limits.

In Haskell, a hom-functor is the mapping of any two types to a function
type, so it's just a parameterized function type. When we fix the second
parameter, let's say to \code{String}, we get the contravariant
functor:

\src{snippet17}
Continuity means that when \code{ToString} is applied to a colimit,
for instance a coproduct \code{Either b c}, it will produce a limit;
in this case a product of two function types:

\src{snippet18}
Indeed, any function of \code{Either b c} is implemented as a case
statement with the two cases being serviced by a pair of functions.

Similarly, when we fix the first argument of the hom-set, we get the
familiar reader functor. Its continuity means that, for instance, any
function returning a product is equivalent to a product of functions; in
particular:

\src{snippet19}
I know what you're thinking: You don't need category theory to figure
these things out. And you're right! Still, I find it amazing that such
results can be derived from first principles with no recourse to bits
and bytes, processor architectures, compiler technologies, or even
lambda calculus.

If you're curious where the names ``limit'' and ``continuity'' come
from, they are a generalization of the corresponding notions from
calculus. In calculus limits and continuity are defined in terms of open
neighborhoods. Open sets, which define topology, form a category (a
poset).
