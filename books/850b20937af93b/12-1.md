\section{Limit as a Natural Isomorphism}

There is still something unsatisfying about this definition of a limit.
I mean, it's workable, but we still have this commutativity condition
for the triangles that are linking any two cones. It would be so much
more elegant if we could replace it with some naturality condition. But
how?

We are no longer dealing with one cone but with a whole collection (in
fact, a category) of cones. If the limit exists (and --- let's make it
clear --- there's no guarantee of that), one of those cones is the
universal cone. For every other cone we have a unique factorizing
morphism that maps its apex, let's call it $c$, to the apex of
the universal cone, which we named $\Lim[D]$. (In fact, I can skip
the word ``other'', because the identity morphism maps the universal
cone to itself and it trivially factorizes through itself.) Let me
repeat the important part: given any cone, there is a unique morphism of
a special kind. We have a mapping of cones to special morphisms, and
it's a one-to-one mapping.

This special morphism is a member of the hom-set $\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$.
The other members of this hom-set are less fortunate, in the sense that
they don't factorize the mapping of the two cones. What we want is to be able to
pick, for each $c$, one morphism from the set
$\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$ --- a morphism that satisfies the particular
commutativity condition. Does that sound like defining a natural
transformation? It most certainly does!

But what are the functors that are related by this transformation?

One functor is the mapping of $c$ to the set
$\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$. It's a functor from $\cat{C}$ to $\Set$ ---
it maps objects to sets. In fact it's a contravariant functor. Here's
how we define its action on morphisms: Let's take a morphism $f$
from $c'$ to $c$:
\[f \Colon c' \to c\]
Our functor maps $c'$ to the set
$\cat{C}(c', \Lim[D])$. To define the action of this functor on
$f$ (in other words, to lift $f$), we have to define the
corresponding mapping between $\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$ and
$\cat{C}(c', \Lim[D])$. So let's pick one element $u$ of
$\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$ and see if we can map it to some element of
$\cat{C}(c', \Lim[D])$. An element of a hom-set is a morphism, so
we have:
\[u \Colon c \to \Lim[D]\]
We can precompose $u$ with $f$ to get:
\[u . f \Colon c' \to \Lim[D]\]
And that's an element of $\cat{C}(c', \Lim[D])$--- so indeed, we
have found a mapping of morphisms:

Notice the inversion in the order of $c$ and $c'$
characteristic of a \emph{contravariant} functor.

\noindent
To define a natural transformation, we need another functor that's also
a mapping from $\cat{C}$ to $\Set$. But this time we'll consider a
set of cones. Cones are just natural transformations, so we are looking
at the set of natural transformations $Nat(\Delta_c, D)$. The mapping
from \code{c} to this particular set of natural transformations is a
(contravariant) functor. How can we show that? Again, let's define its
action on a morphism:
\[f \Colon c' \to c\]
The lifting of $f$ should be a mapping of natural transformations
between two functors that go from $\cat{I}$ to $\cat{C}$:
\[Nat(\Delta_c, D) \to Nat(\Delta_{c'}, D)\]
How do we map natural transformations? Every natural transformation is a
selection of morphisms --- its components --- one morphism per element
of $\cat{I}$. A component of some $\alpha$ (a member of $Nat(\Delta_c, D)$) at
$a$ (an object in $\cat{I}$) is a morphism:
\[\alpha_a \Colon \Delta_c a \to D a\]
or, using the definition of the constant functor $\Delta$,
\[\alpha_a \Colon c \to D a\]
Given $f$ and $\alpha$, we have to construct a $\beta$, a member of
$Nat(\Delta_{c'}, D)$. Its component at $a$ should be a
morphism:
\[\beta_a \Colon c' \to D a\]
We can easily get the latter ($\beta_a$) from the former ($\alpha_a$) by precomposing it with
$f$:
\[\beta_a = \alpha_a . f\]
It's relatively easy to show that those components indeed add up to a
natural transformation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/natmapping.jpg}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Given our morphism $f$, we have thus built a mapping between two
natural transformations, component-wise. This mapping defines
\code{contramap} for the functor:
\[c \to Nat(\Delta_c, D)\]
What I have just done is to show you that we have two (contravariant)
functors from $\cat{C}$ to $\Set$. I haven't made any assumptions
--- these functors always exist.

Incidentally, the first of these functors plays an important role in
category theory, and we'll see it again when we talk about Yoneda's
lemma. There is a name for contravariant functors from any category
$\cat{C}$ to $\Set$: they are called ``presheaves''. This one is
called a \newterm{representable presheaf}. The second functor is also a
presheaf.

Now that we have two functors, we can talk about natural transformations
between them. So without further ado, here's the conclusion: A functor
$D$ from $\cat{I}$ to $\cat{C}$ has a limit $\Lim[D]$ if and
only if there is a natural isomorphism between the two functors I have
just defined:
\[\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D]) \simeq Nat(\Delta_c, D)\]
Let me remind you what a natural isomorphism is. It's a natural
transformation whose every component is an isomorphism, that is to say
an invertible morphism.

I'm not going to go through the proof of this statement. The procedure
is pretty straightforward if not tedious. When dealing with natural
transformations, you usually focus on components, which are morphisms.
In this case, since the target of both functors is $\Set$, the
components of the natural isomorphism will be functions. These are
higher order functions, because they go from the hom-set to the set of
natural transformations. Again, you can analyze a function by
considering what it does to its argument: here the argument will be a
morphism --- a member of $\cat{C}(c, \Lim[D])$ --- and the result will
be a natural transformation --- a member of $Nat(\Delta_c, D)$, or
what we have called a cone. This natural transformation, in turn, has
its own components, which are morphisms. So it's morphisms all the way
down, and if you can keep track of them, you can prove the statement.

The most important result is that the naturality condition for this
isomorphism is exactly the commutativity condition for the mapping of
cones.

As a preview of coming attractions, let me mention that the set
$Nat(\Delta_c, D)$ can be thought of as a hom-set in the functor
category; so our natural isomorphism relates two hom-sets, which points
at an even more general relationship called an adjunction.
